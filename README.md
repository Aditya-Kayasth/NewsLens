# AI-Powered Personalized News Aggregator & Bias Analyzer

## 📌 Project Description
Develop an intelligent web-based platform that aggregates, summarizes, and analyzes news articles in real time. Users can select specific domains (e.g., politics, technology, sports, finance) to receive tailored news updates. Whenever a new article matching the user’s selected interests is published, an instant pop-up notification will appear.

Beyond aggregation, the system will assess bias in articles by comparing multiple sources covering the same event, highlighting differences in sentiment, language, and framing. Users will receive a balanced summary along with an AI-generated credibility score to help them evaluate the trustworthiness of the content.

## 🚀 Why It's Innovative
- **Bias Detection & Transparency**: AI highlights variations in reporting, helping users identify media bias.
- **Real-Time Personalized Updates**: Instant notifications for news in selected domains reduce information overload.
- **AI-Driven Credibility Scoring**: Provides an objective analysis of article reliability based on sentiment, source reputation, and linguistic patterns.
- **Multi-Source Comparison**: Aggregates news from diverse sources, offering a holistic perspective on trending topics.

## 🛠 Technologies Involved
- **Frontend**: React.js (for dynamic UI & pop-up notifications)
- **Backend**: Flask/Django (for API handling & ML integration)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MongoDB (for storing user preferences & news data)

### 🔍 Core AI Components
- **Web Scraping**: Scrapy/BeautifulSoup (for fetching news articles)
- **NLP & Sentiment Analysis**: Hugging Face Transformers, VADER, TextBlob (for bias detection & summarization)
- **Machine Learning**: Custom models trained on media bias datasets (to score article credibility)
